	using a LIDAR system with a 3D attitude estimation system based on
	inertial sensing. By using a fast approximation of map gradients
	and a multi-resolution grid, reliable localization and mapping capabilities
	in a variety of challenging environments are realized. Multiple datasets
	showing the applicability in an embedded hand-held mapping system
	are provided. We show that the system is sufficiently accurate as

	an any-time rescue sequence optimization based on a genetic algorithm.
	We compare the performances of our team and others in terms of their
	capability of extinguishing fires, freeing roads from debris, disaster
	space exploration, and civilian rescue. The evaluation is carried

	Abstract = {Teleoperation is a difficult task, particularly when controlling robots
	from an isolated operator station. In general, the operator has to
	solve nearly blindly the problems of mission planning, target identification,
	robot navigation, and robot control at the same time. The goal of
	the proposed system is to support teleoperated navigation with real-time
	mapping. We present a novel scan matching technique that re-considers
	data associations during the search, enabling robust pose estimation
	even under varying roll and pitch angle of the robot enabling mapping
	on rough terrain.
	
	The approach has been implemented as an embedded system and extensively
	tested on robot platforms designed for teleoperation in critical
	situations, such as bomb disposal. Furthermore, the system has been
	evaluated in a test maze by first responders during the Disaster
	City event in Texas 2008. Finally, experiments conducted within different
	environments show that the system yields comparably accurate maps
	in real-time when compared to higher sophisticated offline methods,
	such as Rao-Blackwellized SLAM. },

	Abstract = {We use visual analytics to assist human experts in the verification of evacuation schedules and enable them to identify the bottle-necks in building evacuation. The user can change parameters, such as the number of occupants present in the rooms, the parametric settings for fire simulation, the building design, etc. and analyze their effect on evacuation. Visualization of the people flow in the building combined with the computational techniques plays a great role in analyzing the evacuation process. This helps in understanding the movement of the people during evacuation, possible delays in evacuation process, etc. and it provides feedback to the user. We introduce a novel priority based distributed evacuation routing (PDER) algorithm that produces dynamic evacuation schedules and is designed to work smoothly and seamlessly in interactive exploratory environments for visual analysis of dynamically updated evacuation schedules.},
