Argumentation Overall Rating

   The paper is very well written and addresses an important topic. An
   analysis system for decision support in rescue-mission planning is
   presented. The employed visualization techniques (parallel coordinates,
   scatter plot matrices, profile plots, linked views) are well known. The
   weak point of the paper is the evaluation. Only three experts have been
   shown the system (admittedly it is very likely not easy to find a large
   number of domain experts on such a specialized application scenario).
   Though the paper gives a convincing motivation for the need of such
   visual decision-support systems, it does not become clear why the design
   choices make sense. How were parallel coordinate plots and scatter plot
   matrices helpful to the domain experts? What knowledge and insight did
   they gain, which would not have been possible without the system? The
   system is tested on post-mortem data, how would it behave in a real-world
   scenario? Would scalability (with respect of number of paths, building
   complexity, dynamics of scene) be an issue? Though the system looks
   interesting, more concrete evidence on the applicability, usability would
   be necessary and limitations should be discussed. In a real-world
   scenario there might be constraints (data acquisition, processing, need
   for optimizations) which could severely impact the usage of the presented
   system. With the very preliminary evaluation and being tested on just one
   scenario, the merit of the system does not become clear.

Argumentation Overall Rating

   In this paper, the author proposed a system to help incident commanders
   make decisions in urban search & rescue scenarios. The problem seems 
   important and the system they proposed seems much better than the current
   workflow. The weaknesses of the paper are: 1) the case study is too short
   and not very convincing. 2) The system has not been tested with any
   real-world application case.  3) The visualizations are well known and
   the paper did not discuss alternative design choices much. It is hard to
   see how other people can benefit from reading this paper.

The Review

   The paper addresses an interesting and challenging analytic problem.
   Urban Searching & Rescuing is indeed very important and according to the
   description of the authors, the current workflow is quite poor (shown in
   Figure 2). The authors proposed a novel visualization system to help
   incident commanders to choose the best path for searching and rescuing.
   The whole system is well presented. 

   Strong points:
   + The question is important 
   + They collaborated with the domain experts and proposed four design
   guidelines for system design
   + The performance of the system they proposed is good (The data
   processing costs about 1~2 minutes and the other parts are in real-time.

   Weak points:
   - The structure of the introduction is confusing. It looks awkward that
   the system requirement appears in the last paragraph of the Introduction.

   - The case study part is weak. The case study seems being conducted by
   the authors themselves, which is not convincing. Due to the lack of the
   real data, it is also hard to know if the system is indeed helpful.
   - The evaluation part is also weak. First, they authors didn’t say if
   the three experts are the same ones who help them point out the four
   requirements. If so, the questions the authors asked are not good.
   Second, just as the experts themselves said, it is not enough to just
   show them the videos. 
   - The visualizations (heatmap, parallel coordinates) used are well known.
   As an application paper, novelty is not a critical criterion. However, we
   expect more discussions on design choices. Have any alternative visual
   designs been considered?  It is not clear how other researchers can
   benefit from reading this paper.

Second Round Recommendation

   

Summary Review Text

   The reviewers tend to a borderline-reject judgement for this paper. 

   Here are the key points:
     + topic is interesting for the community
     + the tasks and use cases are well motivated
     + the system is well described 
     - use cases is interesting but needs more real-world justification 
     - justify and discuss your design decision - as the applied
   visualization
       techniques are well known
     - usability, scalability and limitations must be discussed
     - evaluation is very preliminary and not sufficient to support the
   claims

   Overall, it seems that the paper is not ready for publication.
   The reviewers' concerns on the novelty, justification for design
   decisions, and evaluation, would require major work, and therefore decide
   not to accept this paper. However, would encourage the authors to pursue
   their work and take the reviewers' comments to improve their work.

Argumentation Overall Rating

   the paper is system paper and well written, interesting and well
   motivated.

   the major draw back is that the evaluation does not match the claims.
   i do not think the problem is the evaluation. A system paper, like this
   one could claim useability, comprehensiveness and solving a problem by
   making better decision. this could be then evaluated by an expert study.

The Review

   The paper proposes a visualization system that uses
   the acquired and annotated map during USAR missions to
   support access path planning. The system preprocesses the
   point cloud data to create an interactive three-dimensional
   rendering that is tailored to increase the commander‘s spatial
   awareness of the internal structure and further supports the
   analysis and the planning of viable access paths.

   The motivation clearly and convincingly states the need and use case for
   the described system. The introduction ends with a list of requirement
   statements. These could be split into two independent chapters: keep the
   motivation short, and make a requirement/task analysis chapter with more
   in-depth discussion on what might be relevant and what you are
   addressing.

   The related work and the decision making background is very focused,
   which is adequate for a system-paper!

   The workflow is interesting, but could not find any justification how the
   proposed method shortens or makes the process more efficient, or faster
   or better in any way than the current system. If you state "we decrease
   the overall time to rescue" - you must provide hard evidence!!
   Honestly, is is hard to believe that "exploration" will speed up decision
   making... 

   The system overview is where the paper shines; very well presented,
   comprehensive and follows a logical argumentation and systematic
   approach! well done!

   The implementation chapter is rather unnecessary... after a system -
   chapter, I believe these technical details can be significantly shortened
   within the previous chapter.

   The major problem of the paper is the evaluation. An expert study might
   be adequate if you claim to solve a problem or show information that is
   potentially useful to experts and has not been addressed before. However,
   the evaluation must confirm the claim, and be tight to the claims from
   the motivation. This is not the case in your paper!

   this needs significant improvement.

Argumentation Overall Rating

   In geberal, I liked the paper. One main concern: the authors chose to
   work with a shortest path heuristic and not with the traveling salesman
   solution which seems to me much more relevant and natural in such
   scenarios (the authors actually mention and cite the later problem): one
   would expect a rescuer to go around completing tasks and then exit either
   where he entered or at another location. I would expect at least a clear
   explanation why the authors predefed using the A* algorithm over a
   TSP-approximation (a 2-approximation solution should not be hard to
   program).

The Review

   The paper is interesting and fits the symposium topics. The major
   contribution is a system that uses visualization to help planning rescue
   missions. The ideas look sound to me and useful in practice (neverthless,
   as the experts mention, a real-world evaluation will really help). The
   writing is clear. The figures are nice and illustrative. The main thing
   that I have a doubt about is a convincing discussion why the A* algorithm
   is a better choice than the TSP (or other algorithms?). And if such a
   claim cannot be established (to my opinion TSP seems better in such
   scenarios), why not to shift to a 2-approximation TSP which is not hard
   to implement (or maybe even better approximations).
